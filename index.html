                        <p>Data intrigues me.  They go on PowerPoints.  I love how people use data and try to learn from it.  Since I was fortunate, or you could say unfortunate, helping an extended family member with her business, I saw the operational side of a business that I didn’t get to see when I was working as a salesperson for a retail chain.  From that experience I can sort-of think like a boss, and I am assuming for prospective employers that they have the same questions I have — what is going on under the hood?  From the Data Analyst Bootcamp I am currently attending, I have learned a lot, but I feel I have barely scratched the surface.  I’m excited to keep learning and growing in my current student role.   Feel free to email me at stanley.tan19 @ gmail   Cheers!</p>

                    <p>Ideas and stories are what I like to think about.  They give us meaning and has for thousands of years.  Some stories can inspire us.  Some stories tell us that we need to go another direction.  Others in great books like Miguel Cervantes' Don Quixote teach us and help us forgive others because personally, I don't know about you, there is some of Don Quixote in me.  I would assume that he would eat a lot of bagels if they were around in his time (and if I met him in a story and he tried to attack me, I would forgive him).  Bagels are part of my favorite breakfast. It's interesting to note that the US exports bagels to other countries like Japan.  Did you know?  Bagels sold in supermarkets total over hundreds of millions of dollars every year (Wikipedia). Happy eating!</p>
